        <p class="linebreak"><em>Silver Studio is the name of the art classroom and studio of Karla Silver at the Halifax Grammar School (HGS) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. There I was taught to examine story in visual art, to explore a range of traditional media, to refine my technical studies. Most of all I was encouraged to pursue my passion&mdash;to create art of wildlife. Of my ten-to-twelve pieces entered in the 2007 HGS International Baccalaureate fine-arts show, some were graphic pencil, coloured pencil, oil paint, acrylic paint, pastel, wood-blocking and wood-burning and so on. Karla &ndash; Ms Silver &ndash; was the one who recognized a theme in those early works&mdash;a theme that carried into my sketches of Nakita. Karla also had a husky. Ms Silver shared with me the art of Robert Bateman. A career and my life was given direction. Thank you Karla for seeing the footsteps for me to follow and find my way.</em><sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Robert Bateman">1</a>]</sup></p>

      <div>
        <p>The story behind <em>White Rhino</em> (oil painting, 2007) revolves around a detailed study of wildlife. The offset focus allows the aged rhino to provide perspective and the calf in that perspective to represent a distant hope, while a fires blazes in the sky to put in some context of their endangered state.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Grampa Alan">2</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>The oil painting by Robert Bateman titled <em>Rhinoceros at Ngoro Ngoro</em> served as reference. The pencil study was an early example of my attention to light and shadow in art as well as my passion for wildlife art.<sup>&nbsp;[<a class="button" onclick="fn();" title="Karla Silver">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <div>
          <p><em>Aquila</em> (2006) was my first oil painting. Timidity kept the eagles to a moderate scale and the surrounding environment became a study of the medium itself. The constellations on display are those that appear over British Columbia in spring. The bright diamond in the upper-left is of &lsquo;Aquila&rsquo;, the eagle. The piece also alludes to Haida settlement and a serenity of the time.</p>

          <p>M.C. Escher had me in awe long before I realized art was my passion. As my ability developed, my style was naturally infused with glimpses of Escher concepts. <em>Snake on a Pencil</em> (2006) was sold at the show. All the support was appreciated.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The red foxes were presented as a character study. These colored pencil drawings were part of a portfolio submission requirement for university art programs. These character studies are also an extension of my beloved husky. The two action poses were gifted to my high school headmaster Matthew Moffat (and Laura Brock) for having a positive influence.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Chimps are marvellous creatures. When art program submissions request characters, I cannot think of any more expressive that the Chimpanzee. My drawing style is one of realism I suppose, as opposed to abstract or cartoon. However, after researching many mannerisms of chimpanzees, I have created my own poses and expressions for storytelling. These three are clipped from a longer storyboard.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The idea for <em>Gloves</em> (graphic pencil, 2006) came simply from a desire to capture the material of a pair of soft-leather gloves. If I learned one thing from my International Baccalaureate fine-arts program, it was an appreciation for the effect of light across different materials. In <em>Gloves</em>, I play with perspective, with a contrast of hard and soft edges, and with a variety of textured materials.</p>

          <p>The desert scene on the right followed my discovery of the versatility of graphite over canvas. Using reference from a variety of google images, I excersized the abstract blending of coloured pencil to depict &ndash; as I imagine &ndash; the desert migration of elephants across a barren African savanna.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Here is my attempt at wood blocking, a Japanese form of print. The process entails carefully carving an image out of a flat block of wood, so that the remaining surface can be applied with wet paint and then used to stamp a series of prints on paper. In terms of imagery, I kept the design simple. The idea was based on simple themes of the medium itself. I appropriated the intrinsic quality of the Imperial Japanese flag, despite its war-torn affiliation. The Imperial design is offset, and in the centre of Red Sun I have transcribed the Japanese symbols for &ldquo;Visual Art&rdquo;.</p>

        <div>
          <p>A series of wood burnt gambling sticks was based on a game rather than the medium. This was a traditional form of Haida art resembling miniature totem-poles in which I wood-burned fourteen original Haida-like designs. The imagery was in the style of the interpretations of natural elements within the Haida culture. This featured prominently fish, whales, bald eagles, beavers and stylized faces and so on.</p>

        <p class="text-right gutter-side"><em>Tiger Eye</em> (mixed media, 2004)</p>

        <div>
          <p><em>Tiger Eye</em> (2005) was derived from an unwavering admiration of big cats, and a bit of research. I stumbled upon a literal gem named &lsquo;Tiger Eye&rsquo;. Like most minerals it is beautiful in of itself, however, it also gave me an idea for a project featuring a the gem as the pupil of a mixed media tiger eye. So, gems are expensive. Nevertheless I modeled a white tiger's eye out of a wooden base with metal gauze to shape the eye ball and plaster to secure it in place &agrave; la papier-macher. I then used pastel on the wood for a soft fur texture. I molded clay for the matte around the eye. And I painted a snow-covered plain with acrylic paint directly on the tiger eye. The painting is not quite intended to be a reflection, instead a window into an untouched scene that a tiger might have inhabited&hellip; once upon a time. In place of a sun in the scene &ndash; and the pupil within the tiger eye &ndash; is the &lsquo;Tiger Eye&rsquo; gem!</p>
